2018-10-27:
* Added app to verify Developer Certificate of Origin for pull requests
   * ```"The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.```
   * Pull Requests need to include: ```Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>```. Alternatively, Git has the -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message: ```$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'```
   * For more information, see: https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/
* Added FOSSA license and vulnerability scanning, see http://fossa.io.
   * Sent invite to jay@openrfa.org
